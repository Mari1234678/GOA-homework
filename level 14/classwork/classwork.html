        <h1>What is a HTML</h1>
        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents
         designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
         It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript,
         a programming language.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,
         a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing
         an Internet-based hypertext system.</p>

        <h2>Markup</h2>
        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
            character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and /h1,
            although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag,
            and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
